The reading of the file starts from the line with two $ signs.
You are free to put any text before it.
After the starting pattern the format of the file consist of the comment line
and the configuration line. Order is important - do not change it!
Comment line starts with /* and finishes with */ and contains at least one blank

some example values:

acquisition register setup:  
    internal clock with trigger start: start/stop mode 2100 
    internal clock with key start: 2000; 
    external clock: 6100
    external clock random mode: 6900 

event configuration register setup :
  Page size: bits 2,1,0  of event configuration register,
  0=128KSamples,1=16KSamples,2=4KSamples,3=2KSamples,4=1KSamples,5=512Samples,6=256Samples,7=128Samples.
  to enable random ext clk add 0x800
  => random ext clock with 128kS = 0800
  to enable wrap around with external stop (for test beam) add 0x8
