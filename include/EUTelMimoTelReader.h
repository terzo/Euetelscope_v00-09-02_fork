  //!  Reads the data produced by the EUDRB board with a MIMOTEL sensor
  /*!  This Marlin reader is taking as an input the output file of
   *   the eudaq software and converting it to a LCIO event. This is
   *   linking against libeudaq and using directly the data structure
   *   used in the DAQ software. This has to be thought as a sort of
   *   link between the native DAQ raw format and the LCIO data model
   *   used for the telescope data description.
   *
   *   The main goal of this data reader is to test the quality of
   *   the data output from the hardware but it is going to disappear
   *   soon being the LCIO output already produced by the online
   *   system.
   *
   *   To link against the libeudaq libraries you have to download
   *   and install the library on your computer and then add the
   *   following few lines to the @c userlib.gmk in the Marlin top
   *   folder.
   *
   *   @code
   *   #--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *   #     EUDAQ
   *   #--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *   USERLIBS     += -L/path/to/eudaq/main -leudaq
   *   USERINCLUDES += -DUSE_EUDAQ -DEUDAQ_FUNC=__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ 
   *   USERINCLUDES += -DEUDAQ_PLATFORM=PF_LINUX -I/path/to/eudaq/main/include
   *   @endcode
   *   
   *   To execute Marlin then you need to add the libeudaq.so to the
   *   shared libraries path, for example, using the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   *   environmental variable.
   *
   *   The data decoding is done using the decoder and classed
   *   provided by the DAQ software, so please refer to that
   *   documentation for more info.
   *
   *   Using the data streams provided by the EUDRB Producer the CDS
   *   value for each pixel is calculating using a suitable algorithm
   *   depending on the number of readout frame per event. 
   *
   *   @see @ref cds3frame
   *
   *   The marker removal procedure is done a very general way
   *   allowing to copy paste the same code for a detector with a
   *   different configuration of markers.
