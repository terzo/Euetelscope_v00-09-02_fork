  //! Implementation of the ROOT histogramming interface
  /*! This Marlin processor is playing the role of a ROOT interface in
   *  the meaning that allows the user to use any ROOT objects and
   *  having them saved in the output ROOT file, grouped in folder
   *  named after the processor where the object have been generated.
   *
   *  It is offering the same functionalities of the AIDAProcessor
   *  even if ROOT is not making use of Factories owning all the
   *  produced objects.
   *
   *  This processor is actually built with Marlin only if the user
   *  exported the enviromental variable MARLIN_USE_ROOT before
   *  starting. This is changing the building option in the top level
   *  GNUmakefile.
   *
   *  To use ROOT as histogramming package you need to add this
   *  processor to the list of active processors and it has to be
   *  first processor requiring access to ROOT TObject. Putting this
   *  processor as the first one has to be considered as a good
   *  attitude.
   *
   *  For the time being only the end() method is actually
   *  implemented. When it is called by the ProcessorMgr, a ROOT file
   *  with the user specified name is open for writing. The
   *  _listOfList object is containing a list for each of the active
   *  processors which have added at least one TObject. The list name
   *  corresponds to the processor name.
   *
   *  When the end() method is called, the ROOTProcessor
   *  singleton will open the ROOT output file for writing with the
   *  user specified name.  When the user wants to save a ROOT object
   *  in the file, he/she has to take care of creating the object and
   *  to use the addTObject(Processor*,TObject*) to add it to the list
   *  of objects being saved at the end.
   *
   *  <h4>Input - Prerequisites</h4>
   *  None
   *
   *  <h4>Output</h4>
   *  A ROOT file containing all the objects added by
   *  other processors.

   *  @param ROOT file name
