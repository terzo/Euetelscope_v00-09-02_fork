  //! Zero suppression processor
  /*! This processor is emulating the behaviour Mimosa 26
   *  It uses as input zs data, the pedestal
   *  database, the pedestal, noise and status collection.
   *
   *  The output of this processor is again a TrackerData collection
   *  but filled using sparsified pixels exactly in the same format
   *  the EUDRB would have produced.
   *
   *  The number of parameters is very limited, in fact the user can
   *  only select which kind of sparsified pixel has to be used using
   *  the SparsePixelType enumerator and the sigma cut.

   *  the calibration (mainly pedestal value) as previously saved into
   *  a condition file or database.
   * 
   *  The main things done by this processors are the following: 
   *
   *
   *  <h4>Input collections</h4>
   *  <br><b>ZsDataCollection</b>. This is a collection of
   *  TrackerData containing all pixel signals as they are readout
   *  by the DAQ system in zs mode. This collection is coming from the input
   *  slcio file.  
   *  
   *  <br><b>PedestalCollection</b>. This is a collection of
   *  TrackerData containing all pixel pedestal values as they are
   *  calculated by EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor. This collection is
   *  coming in from the condition file.
   *  
   *  <br><b>NoiseCollection</b>. This is a collection of TrackerData
   *  contaning all pixel noise values as they are calculated by
   *  EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor. This collection is coming from
   *  the condition file and is used only if the user switched on the
   *  common mode calculation.  
   *
   *  <br><b>StatusCollection</b>. This is a collection of
   *  TrackerRawData containing the status of each pixels. This
   *  collection is added to the event by the condition processor and
   *  is used only if common mode flag is active.
   *
   *  <h4>Output</h4>
   *  
   *  <br><b>SparsifiedMimosa26DataCollection</b>. This is a collection of TrackerData
   *  containing sparsified pixel of the type the user selected with
   *  only pixels having signal in excess the sigma value multiplied
   *  by the noise.
   *
   *  @param ZsDataCollectionName Name of the input zs data collection
   *
   *  @param PedestalCollectionName Name of the input (condition)
   *  pedestal collection 
   *
   *  @param NoiseCollectionName Name of the input (condition) noise
   *  collection
   *
   *  @param StatusCollectionName Name of the input (condition) status
   *  collection
   *
   *  @param SparsePixelType This is the type of pixel the user wants
   *  to use for sparsified pixel storage. The SparsePixelType enum
   *  should be for this.
   *
   *  @param SigmaCutVector This is a vector of float with one
   *  component per plane. Each floating number is used as a
   *  multiplicative factor in the definition of the selection
   *  threshold according to 
   *
   *  @code
   *  Threshold[iPixel][iPlane] = Sigma[iPlane] * Noise[iPixel][iPlane]
