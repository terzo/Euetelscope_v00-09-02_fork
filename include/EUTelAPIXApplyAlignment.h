  //! Apply the alignment correction to the input hit collection
  /*! The main goal of this processor is to apply the alignment
   *  correction to the input hit collection.
   *
   *  The alignment constants are, as well, contained into collections
   *  of EUTelAlignmentConstant objects and can be loaded from an
   *  external LCIO file or from a DB query.
   *
   *  <h4>Input collections</h4>
   *  <br><b>InputHit</b>.
   *  This is a collection of TrackerHit containing all the hits that
   *  need to be corrected for misalignment.
   *
   *  <br><b>AlignmentConstant</b>.
   *  This is a collection of EUTelAlignmentConstant. This is a
   *  LCGenericObject  containing all the needed alignment constants
   *  calculated by previous processors.
   *
   *  <h4>Output</h4>
   *
   *  <br><b>OutputHit</b>.
   *  This is a collection of TrackerHit with the correct hits.
   *
   *  @param CorrectionMethod There are actually several different
   *  methods to apply the alignment constants. Here below a list of
   *  available methods:
   *     0. <b>Shifts only</b> No rotations angle will be taken into
   *  account.
   *     1. <b>Rotation first</b> The rotational matrix is applied
   *  before the translation.
   *     2. <b>Translation first</b> The hits are first shifted and
   *  then rotated.
