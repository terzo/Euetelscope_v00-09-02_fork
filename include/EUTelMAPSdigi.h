  //! MAPS digitization processor
  /*! Realistic model based on the beam test results is used to
   *  calculate the expected response of MAPS sensors for the Geant4
   *  simulated hits, as returned by Mokka.
   *
   *  First step: conversion from global reference frame to local
   *  reference frame of individual sensor (based on the GEAR geometry
   *  description) was adopted from EUTelHitMaker.
   *
   *  Each Mokka hit is divided into a number of smaller steps (based
   *  on energy deposit and path length). For each step corresponding
   *  charge deposit in sensor pixels is calculated by 2D integration
   *  of the expected charge density over the pixel surface. Charge
   *  capture in the silicon (signal attenuation) and charge
   *  reflection from the epitaxial layer boundary are taken into
   *  account.
   *
   *  The core of the algorithm is implemented in TDS (Track Detailed
   *  Simulation) package by Piotr Niezurawski (pniez@fuw.edu.pl)
